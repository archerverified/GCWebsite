      "content": "### **Broken Garage Door Spring**\n\nA broken spring can stop your garage door from opening and make it unsafe to operate. We replace torsion and extension springs safely and correctly—often the same day.\n\n### **Garage Door Won’t Open**\n\nIf your garage door won’t open or only lifts a few inches, the issue may involve springs, cables, rollers, or the opener. For safety reasons, we recommend not forcing a stuck garage door, as this can damage the opener or cause the door to shift unexpectedly.\n\n### **Garage Door Opener Replacement**\n\nOlder or unreliable openers can struggle with modern garage doors. We repair and install garage door openers, including quiet and smart opener upgrades.\n\n### **Same-Day Garage Door Repair**\n\nMany garage door issues can’t wait. We offer same-day service in Grand Prairie and nearby cities to get your door working again as quickly as possible."
