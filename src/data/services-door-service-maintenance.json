      "title": "Why Regular Garage Door Maintenance Matters",
      "content": "Garage doors are high-use, high-tension systems. Without routine service, small issues like dry bearings, loose hardware, or worn rollers can gradually lead to bigger failures—such as broken springs, snapped cables, off-track doors, or opener damage.\n\nRegular maintenance improves safety, reduces noise, and helps ensure your garage door opens and closes smoothly every time.\n\n*Many emergency garage door repairs can be avoided with routine maintenance and early detection of wear.*"
