      "content": "Garage door springs wear out over time due to daily use, temperature changes, and door weight.

    {
      "question": "How do I know if my garage door spring is broken?",
      "answer": "Common signs include a garage door that won’t open, opens only a few inches, feels extremely heavy, or makes a loud bang when it fails. You may also see a visible gap in the spring above the door. If you notice any of these symptoms, stop using the door and contact a professional."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I open my garage door with a broken spring?",
      "answer": "It’s not recommended. A broken spring puts excessive strain on the opener and can cause further damage or serious injury. In most cases, the door is unsafe to lift manually without proper equipment and training."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does garage door spring repair take?",
      "answer": "Most broken spring repairs are completed in under one hour. Our technicians carry the proper tools and replacement springs to restore safe operation during the same visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do both garage door springs need to be replaced?",
      "answer": "If your door uses two springs, replacing both at the same time is strongly recommended. Springs wear evenly, and replacing only one often leads to imbalance and another failure shortly after."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of garage door springs do you replace?",
      "answer": "We replace both torsion and extension springs for residential and commercial garage doors. All replacements use manufacturer-approved springs designed for long-term reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is broken garage door spring repair dangerous?",
      "answer": "Yes. Garage door springs are under extreme tension and can cause serious injury if handled improperly. Spring repair should only be performed by trained professionals with the correct tools and experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my garage door opener be damaged if I keep using it with a broken spring?",
      "answer": "Yes. Operating a garage door with a broken spring places extreme strain on the opener and can cause motor, gear, or rail failure. We recommend stopping use immediately and scheduling professional repair."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does broken spring repair cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the size, type, and weight of the garage door, as well as the number of springs required. Garage Cowboy provides clear, upfront pricing before any work begins—no hidden fees."
    },
