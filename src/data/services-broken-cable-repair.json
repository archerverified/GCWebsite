      "content": "Garage door cables and drums work together to lift the full weight of the door evenly. When a cable snaps, frays, or slips off the drum—or when a drum becomes worn or damaged—the door can bind, tilt, or slam shut.\n\nOur technicians carefully secure the door, release unsafe tension, and repair or replace damaged components using **high-quality, manufacturer-approved cables and drums**. We don’t reuse stretched cables or install mismatched parts. Every repair includes proper cable routing, drum alignment, correct tensioning, and a full safety and balance check to ensure smooth, reliable operation."

      "title": "Why Garage Door Cables & Drums Fail",
      "content": "Cables and drums wear over time due to daily use, door weight, moisture exposure, and improper tension. Worn springs, misaligned tracks, or impact damage can place uneven stress on cables, causing fraying or sudden failure. Drums can also wear or crack, allowing cables to slip or unwind.\n\nCorrecting the root cause—not just replacing parts—is essential to preventing repeat failures."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What happens when a garage door cable breaks?",
      "answer": "When a cable breaks, the garage door may lift unevenly, jam, or suddenly drop. Because cables support the full weight of the door, failure creates a serious safety risk and should be addressed immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it dangerous to use my garage door with a broken cable or drum?",
      "answer": "Yes. Operating a door with damaged cables or drums can cause the door to fall, bend tracks, break rollers, or damage the opener. Stop using the door and contact a professional."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes garage door cables or drums to fail?",
      "answer": "Common causes include normal wear, rust or corrosion, improper tension, worn springs, misaligned tracks, and impact damage. Drums can also wear over time, allowing cables to slip."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a broken garage door cable be repaired, or does it need replacement?",
      "answer": "Cables are not safely repairable once damaged. Frayed or broken cables should always be replaced to ensure safe operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do both garage door cables need to be replaced at the same time?",
      "answer": "In most cases, yes. Cables wear evenly, and replacing both helps maintain balance and reduce the risk of another failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does cable or drum repair take?",
      "answer": "Most cable and drum repairs can be completed in a single visit once the door is safely secured. Timing depends on door size and any additional damage found."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you replace the drums if they are worn or damaged?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can a broken cable damage my garage door opener?",
