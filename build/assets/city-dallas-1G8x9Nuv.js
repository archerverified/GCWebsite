We commonly see:

* Broken or fatigued springs on heavier doors  
* Worn rollers and track misalignment  
* Openers struggling to lift oversized or insulated doors  
* Safety sensor and limit issues on older systems

Many Dallas properties also have detached garages or rear-access doors, which require precise balance and alignment to operate safely.`},{title:"Common Garage Door Problems We Fix in Dallas",content:`### **Broken Garage Door Spring**

A broken spring can completely disable your garage door and make it unsafe to operate. We replace torsion and extension springs safely and correctly—often the same day.

### **Garage Door Won’t Open**

If your garage door won’t open or only lifts partway, the issue may involve springs, cables, rollers, or the opener. **For safety reasons, we recommend not forcing a stuck door**, as this can damage the opener or cause sudden door movement.

### **Garage Door Opener Replacement**

Older openers often struggle with modern, heavier garage doors. We repair and install garage door openers, including quiet belt-drive and smart opener upgrades.
