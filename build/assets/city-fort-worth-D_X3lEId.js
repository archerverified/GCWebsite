We commonly see spring fatigue, worn rollers, and cable issues—especially in older neighborhoods and homes with original garage door systems.

Homes with larger doors and attached garages also tend to put more strain on springs and openers, making proper sizing and maintenance especially important.`},{title:"Common Garage Door Problems We Fix in Fort Worth",content:`### **Broken Garage Door Spring**

A broken spring can prevent your garage door from opening and make it unsafe to operate. We replace torsion and extension springs safely and correctly—often the same day.

### **Garage Door Won’t Open**

If your garage door won’t open or only lifts a few inches, the issue may involve springs, cables, rollers, or the opener. **For safety reasons, we recommend not forcing a stuck garage door**, as this can cause additional damage or sudden door movement.
