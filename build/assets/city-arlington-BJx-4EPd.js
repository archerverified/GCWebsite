We commonly see worn rollers, spring fatigue, and opener strain—especially in established neighborhoods and homes with original hardware.

Doors serving two- and three-car garages tend to put additional stress on springs and openers, making proper sizing and routine maintenance especially important.`},{title:"Common Garage Door Problems We Fix in Arlington",content:`### **Broken Garage Door Spring**

A broken spring can prevent your garage door from opening and make it unsafe to operate. We replace torsion and extension springs safely and correctly—often the same day.

### **Garage Door Won’t Open**

If your garage door won’t open or only lifts a few inches, the issue may involve springs, cables, rollers, or the opener. **For safety reasons, we recommend not forcing a stuck garage door**, as this can damage the opener or cause sudden door movement.
